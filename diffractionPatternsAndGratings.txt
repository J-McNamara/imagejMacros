LG TV screen is 700 mm wide 1920 x 1080, RBG out from laptop
1920 / 2 = 960 lines max resolution.

disposable camera 35mm colour film. 
Closest focus without flash is 1m
TV pretty much fills field of view at 1 m. 

35mm wide colour photo film.
35000/960 = 35 micrometer pitch lines - if camera lens can resolve it. 

use imagej macro to draw the image in 4 sectors, left to right, of max resolution, then lower resolutions, 70, 140, 280 ish micron pitch lines. 2x, 4, 8x , 16x larger. Could be too large a range.... so make tighter range also with 1,2,3,4,5x

pics on camera film:
1-8 2x each of normal TV brighness, then max, then medium, then low brightness.
